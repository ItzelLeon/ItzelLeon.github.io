        <p class="lead mb-4">I am a second-year Creative Writing student at the University of California, Riverside. Writing has always been my passion, starting long before I 
        knew it could be a career. Since elementary school, I have been drawn to how stories connect people, spark emotion, and share ideas that might otherwise go unspoken. This 
        curiosity grew into a real love for all types of writing, including scripts, short stories, creative nonfiction, and poetry.<br><br>
        
        During my junior year of high school, I had the opportunity to participate in two paid filmmaking workshops that helped me grow as an artist. In the first 
        workshop, I wrote, directed, and filmed a documentary about my family’s business. This project was both personal and creatively challenging. The film was later nominated at 
        the San Diego Latino Film Festival, which showed me how storytelling can connect cultural and personal experiences in powerful ways. In my second workshop, I collaborated 
        with a team of four other students to create a short film. My role included co-writing the script, assisting in directing, and contributing to costume design. This project 
        was also nominated for a San Diego film festival, reinforcing my passion for working in creative, team-based environments where everyone’s voice shapes the story.<br><br>

        During my sophomore and junior years of high school, I had the opportunity to participate in two paid filmmaking workshops that deepened my skills and artistic perspective.
        In the first, I wrote, directed, and filmed a documentary about my family’s business—a project that was both deeply personal and creatively challenging. The film went on to 
        be nominated at the San Diego Latino Film Festival, an experience that made me realize how storytelling could bridge cultural and personal narratives in meaningful ways.<br><br>
        
Beyond these workshops, one of my most impactful experiences was serving as the scriptwriter for my high school’s broadcast system. In this role, I wrote the weekly scripts for 
on-campus news segments, announcements, and special features. This experience helped me grow as both a writer and communicator—I learned how to encourage audience engagement with words
while working under tight deadlines. It was rewarding to see my scripts come to life through my peers’ performances and to know that my writing helped shape something that reached the 
entire student body.
<br><br>

       At the same time, I was enrolled in a Virtual Reality class that introduced me to a new form of storytelling. We created short films using virtual software, bringing together 
       technology and story in ways I had never experienced before. I wrote scripts for both my personal projects and collaborative group films. At the end of the year, our class of 
       twelve produced a mockumentary-style film of our experience in this newly added class. I co-wrote the script for this project with another classmate, which was an exciting challenge 
       that allowed us to merge multiple voices and ideas into a humorous and promotional story.
